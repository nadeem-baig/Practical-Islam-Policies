        <h3>1. Personal Information:</h3>
        <p>We collect personal information that you provide directly to us through account registration, customer

            information.</p>
        <h3>2. Device and Usage Information:</h3>
        <p>We automatically collect information about your device, including IP address, device type, operating system,
            and browser type. We also gather data about your usage of our app, such as features accessed, time spent on
            the app, and interaction data.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure:</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. However, we may share information
            with third-party service providers for purposes such as payment processing, data analysis, email delivery,
            hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. These service providers are bound by
            confidentiality agreements to ensure the security of your data.</p>
